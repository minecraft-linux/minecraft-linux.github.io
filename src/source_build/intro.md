# Introduction (read first)

If you want to compile from sources make sure to install the basic
prerequirements from below.

## Basic Prerequisites

-   **Ubuntu** - `sudo apt-get install git cmake pkg-config`
-   **Fedora** - `sudo dnf install git make cmake pkg-config`

## What to build

-   You will want to build MSA for Xbox Live support (for the client).
    Without it the game will not support signing in to Xbox Live.
-   The game launcher to run the client.
-   The Qt launcher UI if you want to easily download the .apk from
    Google Play and/or easily manage multiple Minecraft versions.
-   The extract utility if you don't want to use the Qt launcher UI.

## Updating

To update one of the components (so, `msa`, `mcpelauncher` or
`mcpelauncher-ui`), `cd` to it\'s directory and run:
`git pull && git submodule update`. Then follow the same compile
instructions as when doing a normal build, but skip the `git clone`
line. You\'ll still need to follow the install steps again afterwards.

## Uninstalling

If you installed using `make install` in order to uninstall do the
following **as root** (escalate using `sudo su`):

```bash
rm /usr/local/bin/msa-daemon
rm /usr/local/bin/msa-ui-qt
rm /usr/local/bin/msa-ui-gtk
rm /usr/local/bin/mcpelauncher-client
rm -r /usr/local/share/mcpelauncher
rm /usr/local/bin/mcpelauncher-ui-qt
rm /usr/local/share/applications/mcpelauncher-ui-qt.desktop
rm /usr/local/share/pixmaps/mcpelauncher-ui-qt.png
```

Some of the commands may return errors - that's fine as some modules
simply could have been not installed.
