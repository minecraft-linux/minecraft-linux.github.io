# Getting started

The MCPE Launcher is an **unofficial** launcher for the Android version the Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
It uses uses fake JNI (Java Native Interface) to communicate with Minecraft.
MCPE Launcher supports x86, x86_64 armhf, and arm64 versions of Minecraft on both Linux and MacOS

# Installation
## Linux
The MCPE Launcher can be installed in many ways, however the primary method of installation is with the Appimage

### AppImage
Prebuilt linux **AppImages** are available on [Github](https://github.com/minecraft-linux/appimage-builder/releases/tag/v1.0.0-798)
After downloading simply open terminal,
`chmod +x Minecraft_Bedrock_Launcher-x86_64-v1.0.0.798.AppImage` and run it. With some Filemanagers you should be able to run it with double
click, similar to running a `*.exe` file on Windows. Otherwise run it
from a Terminal `Minecraft_Bedrock_Launcher-x86_64-v1.0.0.798.AppImage `

#### Updating
To Upgrade, simply remove the old appimage and download the new version using the above steps
