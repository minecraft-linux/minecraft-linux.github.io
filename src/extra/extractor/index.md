# Extract utility {#extractor}

The extract utility is a simple utility for extracting the game from an
.apk file.

The utility is not provided as a binary, because it is stand-alone and
really straightforward to compile.

## Usage

`mcpelauncher-extract <source .apk> <destination dir>`

| The client binary can use any directory as the game directory, but
  generally the preference is to use
  \~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/versions/1.2.3.4 as the directory for a
  given version, as this allows you to easily multiversion the game.
  This means, that if you have a file called `mcpe.apk` in the current
  working directory and it is of the 1.5.3.0 version of Minecraft and
  would simply like to extract it, you can do it as follows:
| `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/versions/ && mcpelauncher extract mcpe.apk ~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/versions/1.5.3.0`

To start a given version of Minecraft you can then run the
`mcpelauncher-client` with the `-dg` argument, eg.
`mcpelauncher-client -dg ~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/versions/1.5.3.0`
